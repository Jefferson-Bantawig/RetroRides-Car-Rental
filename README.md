## Responsive Design

The webpage is designed to be responsive. Using flexbox and grid, the layout changes when viewed in different screen sizes. The design of the site was first initiated on a 280x653 resolution which is one of the more common resolutions for smartphones. The most clearly noticeable difference between small and large screens is the hero image on the landing screen. It was decided to not add the large hero image on smaller screen for real estate purposes. The responsive design was also tested in other common screen resolutions such as 320px for mobile, 375px, 425px, 768px, 1024px and 1440px. Each is resolution designed to look balanced and aesthetically pleasing to all devices. Another noticeable difference is the overlay feature, which is only active for laptop screens and above, as this feature needs a mouse cursor to activate.

## Feature Considerations
The Fill up form in the Home page, and the contact us form in the Contact us page, is sent to a form dump. The data in this filled in these will not be stored or utilized without the use of JavaScript or python. In the future, this can be an added feature to improve the user experience.

# Problems & Bugs Encoutered

 - There were a few bugs and problems that came up in the making of this code. One of the main ones was the IDE codeanywhere not working a lot of the times, in order to keep my project within the deadline, I resulted to using Vscode in order to store my code. I continued working on my project in vscode whenever Codeanywhere was down, and then pasted my code into Codeanywhere whevener it was back up and running. This is the main reason why my commits in github are so few.

 - There was a bug encountered when validating application and enquire buttons on the landing page. The validator failed because my anchor element nested a button element. The remedy used for this was to get rid of the button element and style the anchor element to look like a button, which in the end passed the validator.
